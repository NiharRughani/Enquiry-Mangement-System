# Enquiry-Mangement-System
This project is a full-stack Enquiry Management System built to demonstrate real-world CRUD operations using modern web technologies.
It allows users to create, view, update, and delete enquiries with instant UI updates and clean user feedback.

The frontend is developed using React with Flowbite (Tailwind CSS) for responsive UI components, while the backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, following a RESTful API architecture.
All data is stored and managed using MongoDB with Mongoose.

The application focuses on:

Proper frontend–backend separation

Reusable components

Centralized state management

Clean API integration

Production-style environment configuration

This project reflects how a real-world form-based system works in production environments.
